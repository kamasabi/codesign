Automatic MacOS codesigner

# What it does
My Codesigner goes through your user-folder and everything in it in order to sign your .component, .app, .vst, .vst3, .au & .bundle files.

This might help you to run unsigned plugins / VSTs within your Digital Audio Workstation(s).

# How to run it
Download the .sh file and open up your Terminal. Type "sh " in your terminal and then drag the downloaded file onto the terminal window and press enter.

# What if this does not help?
Follow the additional steps outlined in the program. If you followed every step and still encounter issues, your installation might be broken or there might be a bug.
