Automatic MacOS codesigner

# What it does
My Codesigner goes through your user-folder and everything in it in order to sign your .component, .app, .vst, .vst3, .au & .bundle files.

This might help you to run unsigned plugins / VSTs within your Digital Audio Workstation(s).

# How do I run it?
Download the .sh file and open up your Terminal. Type "sh " in your terminal and then drag the downloaded file onto the terminal window and press enter.

# What if this does not help?
Follow the additional steps outlined in the program.
